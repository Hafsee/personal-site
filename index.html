        <h3>Web Design & Developmet</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-description">My desire for learning to code was borne out of need to do something different, learn a new skill and use more of my hands and brain to bring ideas to life. I have always been fascinated by computers right from the age of 18, more of the hardware stuff like repair and abit of the technical stuff like troubleshooting and software installation. </p>
